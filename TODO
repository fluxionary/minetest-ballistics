* [x] change all set_velocity to add_velocity if possible
* [x] see notes.txt
* [ ] documentation
 * [x] the whole api
 * [ ] suggestions about how to achieve specific effects
* [x] on_punch_add_velocity needs refinement
* [x] whoosh sound
 * https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/9172
* [x] parameters for pitch adjustment, to reduce its impact on network performance
 * this is update_period
* [ ] target seeking. as an on_activate and on_step behavior, perhaps?
* [ ] calculate initial velocity given a source, target, initial speed, and gravity

future release:
* [ ] wind
* [ ] ability to specify multiple nodes and groups for replace_node
* [ ] implement bounce off entities
* [ ] figure out why bouncing balls never stop moving
* [ ] figure out how to get arrows to stick in objects in a reasonable manner
